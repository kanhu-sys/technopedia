<p>Drone photography allows images and audio/video to be captured that might not be otherwise possible for human photographers and videographers. That capacity can be enabled by the flight abilities of drones, their small size, or their ability to tolerate harsh environments. Drone photography often enables a first-person view (<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/first-person-view-FPV">FPV</a>) that would normally be impossible to achieve.</p>



<p>There are many different drone sizes and designs, including fixed-wing with a propeller or jet engine, as well as many rotor-based designs. Fixed-wing craft often has an edge on altitude and endurance but lack the maneuverability of rotor-based craft. Because they are often chosen for military operations, they are generally more threatening.</p>



<p>Costs of consumer drones can range from under $100 to several thousand dollars. A recent high-end camera designed for drone use, the 80mp iXU 180, is priced at $60,000.</p>
